    "1.1 The order of the sequence based on entropy (Highest to Lowest) would be 1,3 and 2. Since, 1 sequence has more randomness and doesn not follow pattern. As we can see A could be followed by B or B could be followed by another B or A by A and B could be followed by A. However, the randomness in 3 is less than 1 as it pair (A,B), (B,A) and (A,A). FInally, 2 has a fixed pattern where A is followed by B and vice cersa. Hence, 1 being the randomest, has highest entropy and which is followed by 3 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2\n",
    "Redundancy in a language reduces the uncertainity. It makes it easier to understand what meaning word is conveying. Hence, while decoding the meaning of word, redundancy decreases the uncertainity of the meaning. For example, while a speaker is saying some word, the word with redndancy hence vowels are more distinguishable and understandable though we can also get meaning from the consonent alone. However, it would have higher possibility of decoding as something else if redundancy not inserted.\n",

    "1. $Cross entropy = - \\sum_{i} (F(wi)* log(p(w_i)))$\n",
    "If probability of next word is 1 then $log(p(w_i))$ = 0 and hence cross entropy would be zero.\n",
    "2. From what we know of cross-entropy we can say that cross entropy, H(W) is the average number of bits needed to encode each word. This means that the perplexity 2^H(W) or e^ H(w) is the average number of words that can be encoded using H(W) bits. We prefer perplexity for language model, because of the exponent, improvements in perplexity \"feel\" like they are more substantial than the equivalent improvement in entropy. Another is that before they started using perplexity, the complexity of a language model was reported using a simplistic branching factor measurement that is more similar to perplexity than it is to entropy. Hence, perplexity being de facto size of vocabulary, it is preferred over cross entropy in language model."

The value does not hold any meaning, since the units are not comparable - $P1$ and $Q1$ are sets of words that do not refer to the same thing as the characters in $P2$ and $Q2$ (nucleobases in a coding region of a gene). It just so happens that in this particular case the number of unique characters in 2 coincides with the number of unique words in 1. If we presume that each character in 2 substitutes a unique word from 1, the calculation would make sense, as the distributions in $P2$ and $Q2$ would just be different probability distributions (akin to $Q1$, a hypothetical $X1$ and $Y1$). Therefore, if these are two different languages, the information acquired by computing the $D_{KL}(L1 || L2)$ would uncover certain features about the languages' usage of the specified linguistic units. However, languages differ in features and there is rarely (never) a 1:1 mapping accross languages, so in practice it would be difficult to imagine how this method would be calculable and informative."
